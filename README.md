# mkdocs-codeinclude-plugin

A plugin for mkdocs that allows some advanced 'includes' functionality to be used for embedded code blocks.
This is effectively an extended Markdown format, but is intended to degrade gracefully when rendered with a different renderer. 

This README will be extended to include examples at a later date.
